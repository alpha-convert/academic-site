Hiya! I'm Joseph Cutler-- but Joe works just as well. I'm a Junior Computer Science and Math Double Major at Wesleyan University. I grew up in central Connecticut, but I currently live (while not at school) in New York City.

I'm interested in nearly all of programming languages, from type theory and semantics to compilers and optimization. However, I'm most interested in PL approaches to cost analysis.
Since my freshman year, I've been advised by my amazing professors [Dan Licata](http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/) and [Norman Danner](http://ndanner.faculty.wesleyan.edu/) on a cost semantics project,
which extends [previous work](http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/pubs/dlr15inductive/dlr15inductive.pdf) on recurrence extraction to handle <i>amortized analysis</i>.

Outside of my research in programming languages, I'm also interested in math. Most of my coursework has been algebraic in nature, and I'm always interested in using ideas from algebra 
and category theory in the pursuit of good computer science.

Some of my favorite passtimes include squash, poker, tennis, theater, watching Formula 1, and various forms of procrastination including binge-watching YouTube videoos.
