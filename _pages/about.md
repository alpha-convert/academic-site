I'm a 3rd year undergraduate, advised by [Dan Licata](http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/) and [Norman Danner](http://ndanner.faculty.wesleyan.edu/) on a research
project which seeks to formalize amortized analysis by recurrence extraction.

I'm interested in all aspects of programming languages, but I'm particularly interested in cost semantics, computational aspects of modal and substructural type systems, and logical relations.

Outside of research, I also enjoy math, primarly algebra and logic. Iâ€™m always interested in using ideas from algebra and category theory in the pursuit of good computer science.

Before college, I was an avid web developer, and I spent about six total months as a web development intern at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/),
writing Ruby, JS, and Elixir.

I'll be applying to PhD programs in 2020!
