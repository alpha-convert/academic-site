        Joe's Restuarant List
      </div>
      <div class="subsubtitle">
          This is a list of some of the restaurants (and a few bars) I've had the pleasure
          to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by (and overlaps
          significantly with) Penn CS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary list</a> of Philly
          restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
          to the city.
          <br>
          <br>
          In lieu of a rating system, I'll just include a single ★ on restaurants I strongly recommend – the rest I <i>merely</i> recommend.

              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://parc-restaurant.com/">Parc</a>: A massive french bistro good for all occasions. If you like Balthazar in NYC
                    or Le Diplomate in DC, you'll feel right at home at Parc.
                    <br>

                  <li><a href="https://www.rouge98.com/">Rouge</a>: Another option on Rittenhouse. The burger is famous, but I'd pick Parc over Rouge any day of the week.

                  <li><a href="https://www.rosystacobar.com/">Rosy's Taco Bar</a>: Always packed with yuppies, MBA students, and undergrads, but don't let that
                    fool you. The tacos here are legit, as confirmed by multiple Southern-Californians.
                    <br>
                    [22nd and Walnut, $]

                  <li><a href="http://www.1tpl.com/">1 Tippling Place</a>: Cocktail bar with a nondescript entrance. Inside, you'll find refined cocktails in a parlor setting: big leather armchairs, oil paintings, the works.

                    <a href="http://budandmarilyns.com/">Bud and Marilyns</a>: Southern comfort food, but with a slightly odd, vaguely retrofuturist vibe. Good fried chicken.

                  <li><a href="https://www.abefisherphilly.com/">Abe Fisher</a>: Inventive takes on the traditional cuisine of the Ashkenazi Jewish diaspora. The appetizers were incredible, and filling enough for a whole meal.

                  <li><a href="https://www.walnutstreetcafe.com/">Walnut Street Café</a>: Brunch spot in the base of the FMC tower. A bit of an instagram-trap, but a fine option for brunch west of the river.
                    <br>
                    [30th and Chestnut, $$]

                  <li><a href="https://www.renatas-kitchen.com/">Renata's Kitchen</a>: A hodge-podge of Mediterranean & Middle-Eastern food. Doesn't quite know what it wants to be, but succeeds at what it's doing nonetheless.

                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.whitedog.com/">White Dog Café</a>: A Penn staple. The decor is dog-themed, but the classic, farm-to-table american cuisine is much better than dog food.
