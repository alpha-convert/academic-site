    Joe's Restaurant List
  </div>
  <div class="subsubtitle">
    This is a list of some of the restaurants (and a few bars) I've had the pleasure
    to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by Penn CIS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary
      list</a> of Philly
    restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
    to the city.
    I track all of my restaurant visits on <a href="https://beliapp.co/profile/alpha_convert?&utm_source=copy_qr_code">Beli</a>, if you want updates day-to-day for some reason.
    <br>
    <br>
    In lieu of a rating system, I'll just include a single ★ on restaurants I strongly recommend – the rest I merely
    recommend.
