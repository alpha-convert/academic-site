    Joe's Restaurant List
  </div>
  <div class="subsubtitle">
    This is a list of some of the restaurants (and a few bars) I've had the pleasure
    to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by (and overlaps
    significantly with) Penn CIS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary
      list</a> of Philly
    restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
    to the city.
    <br>
    <br>
    In lieu of a rating system, I'll just include a single ★ on restaurants I strongly recommend – the rest I merely
    recommend.

      <h1>Rittenhouse & Fittler Square</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.fridaysaturdaysunday.com/">Friday Saturday Sunday</a>: This restaurant didn't win the
          James Beard Oustanding Restaurant award in 2023 for no reason.
          Exactly what you want out of a New American tasting menu – course after course of "How did they do that?"
          <br>
          [21st and Spruce, $$$$, ★]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.trattoriacarina.com/">Trattoria Carina</a>: Italian food in a fantastic location. Best
          in the summer, when there's plentiful outdoor seating.
          <br>
          [22nd and Spruce, $$$, ★]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://parc-restaurant.com/">Parc</a>: A massive french bistro good for all occasions. If you like
          Balthazar in NYC
          or Le Diplomate in DC, you'll feel right at home at Parc.
          <br>
          [18th and Locust, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://thedandelionpub.com/">The Dandelion</a>: Previously thought to be impossible, The Dandelion
          proves that English food can be made to taste good.
          <br>
          [18th and Sansom , $$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://barbombon.com/">Bar Bombón</a>: Vegan versions of Latin American food's greatest hits. Bar
          Bombón's main attraction is its (very cute) bar, which sports
          an impressive collection of Latin Amercan liquor.
          <br>
          [18th and Moravian, $$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.rouge98.com/">Rouge</a>: Another option on Rittenhouse. The burger is famous, but I'd
          pick Parc over Rouge any day of the week.
          <br>
          [18th and Locust, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://akitchenandbar.com/">a.kitchen</a>: Another restaurant in the Ellen Yin empire. Great
          cocktails available in the attached bar.
          <br>
          [18th and Walnut, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://ambrosiabyob.azurewebsites.net/">Ambrosia</a>: Adorable Italian BYOB tucked between two old
          brick buildings by the river. Probably not run by the mob, unlike many Italian BYOs.
          <br>
          [18th and Locust, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://hudaphl.com/">Huda</a>: Milk-Bun sandwiches. Like nothing I've ever had before.
          <br>
          [18th and Ludlow, $$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.vialocusta.com/">Via Locusta</a>: Family style modern Italian food, part of the
          Schulson empire. Handmade pasta, well-sourced seafood, cocktails. When they say
          2-3 plates per person, they mean it – the portions are small.
          <br>
          [18th and Locust, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://bolophl.com/">Bolo</a>: Inventive takes on traditional Latin-American food, and rum-centric drinks. Service was poor the day I went, but they'd just been nominated for a James Beard award, so I'll allow it.
          <br>
          [20th and Locust, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.rosystacobar.com/">Rosy's Taco Bar</a>: Always packed with MBA students and undergrads,
          but don't let that
          fool you. The tacos here are legit, as confirmed by multiple Southern-Californians.
          <br>
          [22nd and Walnut, $$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://philadelphia.villagewhiskey.com/">Village Whiskey</a>: High-quality pub food, prepared with
          care. Extensive whiskey selection,
          as the name suggests.
          <br>
          [20th and Sansom, $$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.masalakitchenphilly.com/">Masala Kitchen</a>: Indian street food, specializing in kati rolls.
          Those in a position to know say it's <em>extremely</em> authentic.
          <br>
          [20th and Chestnut, $]
        </li>

        <li><a href="http://www.1tpl.com/">1 Tippling Place</a>: Cocktail bar with a nondescript entrance. Inside,
          you'll find refined cocktails in a parlor setting: big leather armchairs, oil paintings, the works.
          <br>
          [20th and Chestnut, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.andrahem.com/">Andra Hem</a>: "Scandanavian inspired" cocktail bar. Very neatly done
          space. Menu was inventive, but the kitchen was closed so we couldn't try any food.
          <br>
          [16th and Chancellor, $$$]
        </li>

        <li><a href="https://harpcrown.com/">Harp & Crown</a>: The real star of Harp & Crown is the space: 30-foot
          vaulted ceilings, a de-industrialized vibe, and a downstairs bowling alley & speakeasy.
          The menu tries a bit too hard to be interesting, but everything we had was quite good.
          <br>
          [15th and Sansom, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.dandanrestaurant.com/">DanDan</a>: High end Sichuan restaurant. Not the most authentic,
          according to those in a position to know.
          <br>
          [16th and Sansom, $$$]
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.southgatephilly.com/">SouthGate</a>: Korean-American Gastropub. Weird combo, but it really works.

          about Zahav that hasn't already been said.
