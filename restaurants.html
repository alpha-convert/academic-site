        Joe's Restuarant List

      <div class="subsubtitle">
          This is a list of some of the better restaurants I've had the pleasure
          to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by (and overlaps
          significantly with) Penn CS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary list</a> of Philly
          restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
          to the city.

                  <li><a href="https://forkrestaurant.com/">Fork</a>: Refined New American food that never disappoints. Owned and operated by the legendary Ellen Yin,
                    one of Philly's many great restauranteurs (and Penn alumnus!).

                  <li><a href="https://www.forsythiaphilly.com/">Forsythia</a>: Modern French. Truly inventive and fun menu backed up by fantastic service.
                    Opened in early 2020 so still figuring some things out.

                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.rouge98.com/">Rouge</a>: Another option on Rittenhouse. The burger is famous, but I'd pick Parc over Rouge any day of the week.

                  <li><a href="https://www.rosystacobar.com/">Rosy's Taco Bar</a>: Always packed with yuppies, MBA students, and undergrads, but don't let that
                    fool you. The tacos here are for real, as confirmed by multiple Californians.
                    <br>
                    [22nd and Walnut, $]

                    <a href="http://budandmarilyns.com/">Bud and Marilyns</a>: Southern comfort food with a retro vibe. Not to be mistaken for the famous Philly dive bar <a href="https://www.bobandbarbaras.com/">Bob and Barbara's</a>.
                    <br>

                  <li><a href="https://www.renatas-kitchen.com/">Renata's Kitchen</a>: Modern takes on Mediterranean & Middle-Eastern. Doubles as a fantastic happy hour spot, in a location just out of the way enough that it's not packed with undergrads.

                    [40th and Baltimore, $$]
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.whitedog.com/">White Dog Caf√©</a>: A Penn staple. The decor is dog-themed, but the classic, farm-to-table american cuisine is much better than dog food.
                    <br>
                    [34th and Sansom, $$]

                  <li><a href="http://www.1tpl.com/">1 Tippling Place</a>: Cocktail bar with a nondescript entrance. Inside, you'll find refined cocktails in a parlor setting: big leather armchairs, oil paintings, the works.

                    [20th and Chestnut, $$$]

                    <a>Cira Green</a>: Bar in a public green space atop a parking garage on the Schuylkill river! The drinks are pricey and the food is bad, but you can't beat the views.
