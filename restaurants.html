        Joe's Restaurant List
      </div>
      <div class="subsubtitle">
          This is a list of some of the restaurants (and a few bars) I've had the pleasure
          to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by (and overlaps
          significantly with) Penn CS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary list</a> of Philly
          restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
          to the city.
          <br>
          <br>
          In lieu of a rating system, I'll just include a single ★ on restaurants I strongly recommend – the rest I <i>merely</i> recommend.

                  <li><a href="https://www.zahavrestaurant.com/">Zahav</a>: Yes, it really is that good. Legendary Israeli cuisine that 100% lives up to the hype. There's not much I could say
                    about Zahav that hasn't already been said.

              <li><a href="https://www.thanalphilly.com/">Thanal Indian Tavern</a>: Casual-but-not-too-casual indian sit-down. In kind of an odd location, but one which is often convenient for dinner with friends visitng town.

              <li><a href="https://www.cantinafeliz.com/la-calaca-feliz">Cantina "Calaca" Feliz</a>: Mexican restaurant that can accomidate large groups. Not as good as Rosy's, but it has the
                benefit of being very close to the art museum.

              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://parc-restaurant.com/">Parc</a>: A massive french bistro good for all occasions. If you like Balthazar in NYC
                    or Le Diplomate in DC, you'll feel right at home at Parc.
                    <br>

                  <li><a href="https://barbombon.com/">Bar Bombón</a>: Vegan versions of Latin American food's greatest hits. Bar Bombón's main attraction is its (very cute) bar, which sports
                    an impressive collection of Latin Amercan liquor.
                    <br>

                  <li><a href="https://www.rouge98.com/">Rouge</a>: Another option on Rittenhouse. The burger is famous, but I'd pick Parc over Rouge any day of the week.

                    [18th and Walnut, $$$]
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://ambrosiabyob.azurewebsites.net/">Ambrosia</a>: Adorable Italian BYOB tucked between two old brick buildings by the river.

                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.vialocusta.com/">Via Locusta</a>: Family style modern Italian food, part of the Schulson empire. Handmade pasta, well-sourced seafood, cocktails. When they say 
                    2-3 plates per person, they mean it – the portions are small.
                    <br>

                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.rosystacobar.com/">Rosy's Taco Bar</a>: Always packed with yuppies, MBA students, and undergrads, but don't let that
                    fool you. The tacos here are legit, as confirmed by multiple Southern-Californians.
                    <br>
                    [22nd and Walnut, $]
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://philadelphia.villagewhiskey.com/">Village Whiskey</a>: High-quality pub food, prepared with care. Extensive whiskey selection,
                    as the name suggests.
                    <br>
                    [20th and Sansom, $$]

                  <li><a href="http://www.1tpl.com/">1 Tippling Place</a>: Cocktail bar with a nondescript entrance. Inside, you'll find refined cocktails in a parlor setting: big leather armchairs, oil paintings, the works.
                    <br>
                    [20th and Chestnut, $$$]

                  <li><a href="https://www.andrahem.com/">Andra Hem</a>: "Scandanavian inspired" cocktail bar. Very neatly done space. Menu was inventive, but the kitchen was closed so we couldn't try any food.
                    <br>
                    [16th and Chancellor, $$$]
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.abefisherphilly.com/">Abe Fisher</a>: Inventive takes on the traditional cuisine of the Ashkenazi Jewish diaspora. The appetizers were incredible, and filling enough for a whole meal.
                    <br>
                    [17th and Sansom, $$$, ★]
                  </li>
                  <li><a href="https://harpcrown.com/">Harp & Crown</a>: The real star of Harp & Crown is the space: 30-foot vaulted ceilings, a de-industrialized vibe, and a downstairs bowling alley & speakeasy.
                    The menu tries a bit too hard to be interesting, but everything we had was quite good.

                    <a href="http://budandmarilyns.com/">Bud and Marilyns</a>: Southern comfort food, but with a slightly odd, vaguely retrofuturist vibe. Good fried chicken.

                    <a href="https://talulasgarden.com/">Talula's Garden</a>: Sizable portions at sizable cost. Cheese plate was fun, but the meal was lacking for how much we paid.

                    Entry is free, food and drink are overpriced --- you're paying for the fantastic view and fun vibes.

                    The ``pods'' which give the restuarant its name feature RGB lighting that can be changed by pressing buttons on the walls of the pod.
