        Joe's Restaurant List
      </div>
      <div class="subsubtitle">
          This is a list of some of the restaurants (and a few bars) I've had the pleasure
          to visit while living in Philly. It's heavily inspired by (and overlaps
          significantly with) Penn CIS <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/restaurants.html">Prof Lyle Ungar's legendary list</a> of Philly
          restaurants, which is required reading for any food-loving new arrival
          to the city.
          <br>
          <br>
          In lieu of a rating system, I'll just include a single ★ on restaurants I strongly recommend – the rest I merely recommend.

                    Exactly what you want out of a New American tasting menu – course after course of "How did they do that?"

                  <li><a href="https://barbombon.com/">Bar Bombón</a>: Vegan versions of Latin American food's greatest hits. Bar Bombón's main attraction is its (very cute) bar, which sports
                    an impressive collection of Latin Amercan liquor.

                  <li><a href="https://www.vialocusta.com/">Via Locusta</a>: Family style modern Italian food, part of the Schulson empire. Handmade pasta, well-sourced seafood, cocktails. When they say 
                    2-3 plates per person, they mean it – the portions are small.

                  <li><a href="http://www.1tpl.com/">1 Tippling Place</a>: Cocktail bar with a nondescript entrance. Inside, you'll find refined cocktails in a parlor setting: big leather armchairs, oil paintings, the works.

                  <li><a href="https://www.andrahem.com/">Andra Hem</a>: "Scandanavian inspired" cocktail bar. Very neatly done space. Menu was inventive, but the kitchen was closed so we couldn't try any food.

                  <li><a href="https://harpcrown.com/">Harp & Crown</a>: The real star of Harp & Crown is the space: 30-foot vaulted ceilings, a de-industrialized vibe, and a downstairs bowling alley & speakeasy.
                    The menu tries a bit too hard to be interesting, but everything we had was quite good.
